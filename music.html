									<h3>Barely Breaking</h1>
									<p>I never though it would be quite this simple but I always seem to follow down this road to you, straight to you<br>
									<br>
									I watch the scenes outside go by, I'm holding on too long I'm stuck on you, I'm stuck on you<br>
									<br>
									Hold on I'm dying baby<br>
									You really drive me crazy<br>
									Can't breathe I'm suffocating<br>
									Hold on um barely breaking<br>
									<br>
									Hold on wait I'm feeling something different now<br>
									Don't apologize to me<br>
									Thief in the night you took my hand in my heart and now I'm never gonna sleep in peace<br>
									Thinking wondering if things'll change now<br>
									It's too late I guess we'll see<br>
									I'm taking it back, all on my own<br>
									Open the doors I've got the key<br>
									<br>
									Thinking back over the times together<br>
									You never seemed to care about just you and me, you and me<br>
									<br>
									You left me there all alone, and now I realize the things I truly need, oh I need<br>
									<br>
									Hold on I'm dying baby<br>
									You really drive me crazy<br>
									Can't breathe I'm suffocating<br>
									Hold on um barely breaking<br>
									<br>
									Hold on wait I'm feeling something different now<br>
									Don't apologize to me<br>
									Thief in the night you took my hand in my heart and now I'm never gonna sleep in peace<br>
									Thinking wondering if things'll change now<br>
									It's too late I guess we'll see<br>
									I'm taking it back, all on my own<br>
									Open the doors I've got the key</p>
								</div>

									<h3>On My Own</h3>
									<p>Being alone in this world of hate<br>
									Forces me to appreciate<br>
									The little things that keep the world Spinning inside my mind<br>
									<br>
									The sun the moon the stars above<br>
									whisper at night thoughts of love<br>
									They keep me awake throughout the pain<br>
									of being a stranger to the lies and games<br>
									<br>
									Even though I'm all alone there's something better later on<br>
									<br>
									I don't want to be, something someone else wants me to see<br>
									The colors of stars that fill my eyes, see something greater than my own demise<br>
									<br>
									I don't want to speak, the words that fill the inside of another's cheek<br>
									Even though the road is rough and I'm all alone, I know that I can stay strong and make it on my own<br>
									<br>
									The obstacles that plague my path<br>
									Will lead me to an aftermath<br>
									That's better than any pain or grief inside this earthly woe<br>
									<br>
									The fear of being tossed out on the street at night<br>
									opens up my wounded sight<br>
									And shows me the truth of life and death<br>
									When I think I'm taking my last breath<br>
									<br>
									Even though I'm all alone there's something better later on<br>
									<br>
									I don't want to be, something someone else wants me to see<br>
									The colors of stars that fill my eyes, see something greater than my own demise<br>
									<br>
									I don't want to speak, the words that fill the inside of another's cheek<br>
									Even though the road is rough and I'm all alone,<br>
									I know that I can stay strong and make it on my own</p>
								</div>

									<h3>Tides</h1>
									<p>Sunset looking early night<br>
									Our souls on board this upward flight<br>
									Sitting here with you makes this whole world seem alright<br>
									<br>
									Clouds are burning all away<br>
									Barely holding on to day<br>
									I see that bright ol' smile on you and you look at me and say<br>
									<br>
									Don't you fret my little child<br>
									We can talk, and rest a while<br>
									Just listen here, listen right here<br>
									There's someone watching over us<br>
									Even if you don't believe me trust<br>
									The mission is clear, ever so clear<br>
									<br>
									Walking away from Mission Beach<br>
									I went on my own to slowly reach<br>
									Those who needed help they could not find<br>
									<br>
									Your words were with me in my mind<br>
									The short while ago there when you signed<br>
									The lesson of hope on my heart with a pen<br>
									<br>
									(Chorus)<br>
									<br>
									Now I'm all grown up and old<br>
									But the stories that you always told<br>
									Stuck with me through thick and thin all<br>
									<br>
									I'll never forget the way you faced<br>
									All the problems that filled up the space<br>
									Now and then I go back that special place<br>
									<br>
									(Chorus)</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h3>Live it Now</h1>
									<p>(Verse 1)<br>
									Summer nights are never grey<br>
									Chilling by the fireplace<br>
									You got my heartbeat in your hand<br>
									Buried it underneath the sand<br>
									<br>
									These things you make me feel inside<br>
									I have no words to describe<br>
									Bottled it up and kept the change<br>
									Instead of that I learned to say<br>
									<br>
									(Chorus)<br>
									La da da da da da da<br>
									La da da da da<br>
									My tongues tied up I can't deny<br>
									You just make me feel alive<br>
									<br>
									La da da da da da da<br>
									La da da da da da<br>
									Come take my hand and figure out<br>
									This life won't last let's live it now<br>
									<br>
									(Verse 2)<br>
									Looking up the sky at night<br>
									The constellations shown so bright<br>
									Laying on a Pick-up truck<br>
									This happiness can not be luck<br>
									<br>
									Still can't seem to put in words<br>
									This thrilling life that I observe<br>
									Instead of using anything<br>
									I'll use my voice, get up and sing<br>
									<br>
									(Bridge)<br>
									This life won't last with you being so blue<br>
									Go by and by and on and on 'till there's nothing more to do<br>
									</p>
								</div>
								<div>
									<h3>Time of the Year</h1>
									<p>My life's in chains this is not how it should be<br>
									There's got to be an answer out there waiting for me<br>
									<br>
									Thoughts spinning in my head I've got to find out where I should be<br>
									Now it's time to put one and two, one and two into three<br>
									<br>
									(Chorus)<br>
									It's my time, it's my chance, it's my way to get out<br>
									There's nothing left in this life 'cept this path I'm going down<br>
									I am free, I am far, like a distant shooting star<br>
									Everything is going just right for me<br>
									<br>
									Bought a used guitar and a credit card<br>
									Got a day job saving real hard<br>
									Getting rid of what I don't need in my front yard<br>
									<br>
									I'm going all right, I'm doing fine, I told ya babe it's my time<br>
									Living check to check and week to week<br>
									<br>
									(Chorus 2x)</p>
